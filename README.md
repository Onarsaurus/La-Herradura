Origin/Background Information: La Herradura is an authentic Mexican restaurant located in Sheridan, Wyoming. It was founded by Rey Mundo in 2019. Hoping to have online ads that will bring viewers to his restaurant, I've agreed to help deliver his vision. 

The Goal: Iâ€™d like to create a website that quickly and smoothly conveys everything one needs to know about La Herradura, in hopes that anyone in the area or travelling will find something of value and visit the restaurant. 

Present Day: The website is running and has home, menu, about, and location pages which have been in agreement with Reys wishes. 

To Be Done, as of 7/9/2025: The menu page needs to be traversed easier and is being addressed with the addition of buttons to return users to the top sections. The location page could be changed entirely, allowing for easier access to company hours. Integrating the website with the company logo/colors better. Better mobile viewing. Fixing a few inconsistencies. Getting ads up, in hopes of bringing WY residents and travelers. Potentially integrating orders or services like Door Dash/Uber Eats.

7/21/2025 Update: Menu Page has improved navigation, hours and location page has been finalized, header is now an image I created from inspiration using the physical painting posted outside the restaurant (website looks much more visually appealing), mobile viewing has been improved, but now needs further improvement for header image.
